kfsintegr
=========
The purpose of this module is to periodically check integrity of specified file and
it's hash and inform user application if the file was cirrupted (violated).

The module consists from 2 parts:

   kfsintegr - kernel thread which periodically checks specified files and hash sum,
               and add event in case if the file was corrupted (calculated hash differs
               from the specified one, and if the file being corrupted has correct hash.

   securityfs - there is 2 files which user app can use to specify file and monitor the events:
               
               1) /sys/kernel/security/fsintegr/config

                  This file allows to add or del files for integrity checking in the format:

                      add:<alg>:<hash>:file:<file>
                      del:file:<file>
                  
                  where:
                      <alg> - hash alg name, "sha1" or "md5".
                      <hash> - hex value of the hash (without 0x prefix).
                      <file> - file path starts with "/".

               2) /sys/kernel/security/fsintegr/events

                  User app may read the integrity events from this file about
                  detected violation or if the file was fixed, events are automatically removed
                  after they got read, so user app needs to case about storing them.

TODO
====
1) Add ability to configure interval monitoring via securityfs file entry.

2) Add tests cases to test the module.
