fsintegr
========
Periodically monitors the integrity of the specified files and hashes.
The application may run in foreground or backround mode (-d option),
in the background mode it requires the root privileges.

Application reads files and hashes from the config file (-c option or /etc/fsintegr.conf)
and periodically checks them for the integrity by calculating file hash each time.
The file might be specified in the 2 modes:

    raw - the whole file is enhashed
    elf - only .text, .data and .rodata are enhashed

It is possible to only enhash the specified file via command line:

    fsintegr -e FILE -a sha1 -t elf # print file's SHA1 of the ELF sections only
    fsintegr -e FILE -a md5 -t raw # print file's MD5 hash of the whole file

The config file has the following format (w/o any spaces or delimiters except ':'):

    <alg>:<hash>:raw:path
    <alg>:<hash>:elf:path

where:

    <alg> - hash alg, may be "sha1" or "md5"
    <hash> - hexadecimal value of the hash (w/o 0x prefix).

To reload the configration it is possible to send SIGHUP signal.

If the file was corrupted then it will be logged into the console/syslog/file,
if it was specified as "elf" then it's PID will be logged too (if the application is running).

TODO
----
1) Add ability to specify/configure time interval.
